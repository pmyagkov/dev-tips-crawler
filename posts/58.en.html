<p><em>Or what are essentially cut/copy &amp; paste operations.</em></p>
<p>You can easily change the DOM without having to edit the HTML as a big piece of string.</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click on a node and select <em>Copy</em>.</li>
<li>You can paste in your code editor, or for prototyping, you can paste the DOM node elsewhere in the DOM tree. The pasted node is inserted as a child of the currently selected node. In the video, I use the left arrow key to jump to the immediate parent opening tag and paste there (which is what I do in most cases).</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also Cut (right click &gt; Cut, Cmd + x/Ctrl + x) a DOM node and paste - which has the effect of moving the node.</p>
<p><em>Experiment:</em> Try adding more links in the header/footer of a site using this copy and paste technique and figure out at which point the layout needs improving!</p>
