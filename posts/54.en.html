<p>The Timeline Panel in Canary can highlight certain frames red. This is because it has an associated warning, in this case, the frame took longer than 18ms.</p>
<p>If you click on the frame, the Timeline Panel Summary Pane shows the reason in the form of a warning.</p>
<p>If a screen is refreshing 60 times per second (which many screens do), that&apos;s only ~16ms per frame (since <em>1000 milliseconds /  60 fps = ~16ms</em>).</p>
