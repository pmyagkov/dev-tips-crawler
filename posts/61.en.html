<p>You can <em>Tab</em> through the significant portions of a CSS Rule. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A selector (e.g. h1)</li>
<li>A property (e.g. color)</li>
<li>A value (e.g. green)</li>
</ul>
<p>Did you know you can also <em>Shift + Tab</em> to cycle backwards?</p>
<p>Tabbing works through <em>multiple</em> rules.</p>
<p>If you start typing out a new property (like <code>back</code>), you might rely on autocompletion to get <code>background</code>, but you actually end up with <code>background-colour.</code> Even you&apos;re in the next field (the value field), simply hit backspace to highlight the previous field, at which point you can fix it.</p>
<p>While on the subject, you can delete a declaration (the property + value) by hitting backspace in either the property or value field and then hitting enter.</p>
