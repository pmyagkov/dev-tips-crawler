=====
<p>There&apos;s a hidden experiment in Canary DevTools called the <em>Layout Editor</em>. While things are likely to change, here&apos;s some information on what it does:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you inspect an element, markers appear at the boundaries of it within the webpage.</li>
<li>If you drag the markers, they affect the margin or padding of the element.</li>
<li>The markers specify the current margin/padding value as you change it.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="dt-warning">Warning: This is an experimental feature currently in Canary! Things are likely to change. Some experimental features are removed.</span></p>
